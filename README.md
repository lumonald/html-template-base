# html-template-base

Bare bones HTML template starter kit.

When developing, edit:

- `app/index.pug`
- `app/scss/style.scss`
- `app/js/main.js`

Also whilst developing make sure to run the default gulp command:

`$ gulp`

This generates readable versions of compiled HTML, CSS and JS and will watch for changes as you code.

Also you can run:

`$ gulp minify`

This generates minified versions of compiled HTML, CSS and JS and can be used as a one-off command, this will not watch for changes.
